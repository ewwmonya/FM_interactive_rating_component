## My process
I was Taught to start with js First Always. And Always Practice. Also, using Var() is way better to freestyle code with. If you have a theme/pallete already just set it up, you'll thank me later. I mainly did this for the Js but it works. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Pretty much the basics. This is a great project people who feel like they are in tutorial hell. Just don't watch videos.
### Continued development

More JavaScript. Also, do the Quote project next.
